> This is a fun app.

-> Given a string, his program returns the longest substring in alphabetical order.If two substrings are of same length, then alphabetical precedence is given the priority.

-> Run the dock_str.py file

-> (It might ask for internet access,a window might pop up, allow access)->Go to the web browser, open a new tab

-> Type 'localhost:8080/alpha?s=(Provide the string)' ->press enter e.g: localhost:8080/alpha?s=I am a good boy ->press enter

-> The longest alphabetical string will pop up on the web page

Future Work:

-> In future this work can be extended to incorporate other interesting as well as useful features.

-> This can be upgarded for large text files, and can be used to return values like number of total letters, vowels, consonants etc.

->String count, guessword this kind of interesting games can also be built on this platform.
